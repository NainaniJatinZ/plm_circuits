#displays spheres for inorganic ligands (eg ions)
show spheres, inorganic
#displays spheres for organic ligands

# colors I used for CNN paper were "grey80" for whole chain, "green1" for previously discovered mutations, 
# "purple" for new mutations, and "lightorange" for ligands
# for creating figures, use "ray 800, 800", then File -> Export Image As -> PNG to get high quality images
